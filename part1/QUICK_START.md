# Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up the application using Docker Compose:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Change to the directory ``./part1/compose`` with the ``docker-compose.yaml`` file.
3. Start Timescale database in detached mode by executing ``docker compose up -d``.
4. Run ``main.py`` to ingest some mock data to Timescale.
